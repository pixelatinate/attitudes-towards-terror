Saturday marks the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, a day of horror that left 2,753
dead in New York and thousands more injured.
It is hard to overstate how much things changed after the attacks, from the commercial
makeup of Lower Manhattan and airline travel to personal relationships and private lives.
Even now, the remains of those who died are still being identified.
As my colleague Dan Barry asks, what does it mean to “never forget”? Someday, he writes,
there will be no one alive with a personal narrative of Sept. 11, and time will transform a
visceral memory into a history lesson.
But for now, for many, the day remains a lived experience. Here are just some of the ways
Sept. 11 changed the city and its people forever.
[Read more of our coverage marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.]
How 9/11 changed policing
Surveillance technology that came into use after Sept. 11 has fundamentally changed the way
the New York Police Department operates, altering its approach to finding and foiling
terrorist threats, but also to cracking minor cases.
New Yorkers going about their daily lives routinely encounter digital surveillance tools like
facial recognition software, license plate readers or mobile X-ray vans.
Both supporters and critics of the shift say the attacks profoundly changed American
policing — perhaps most acutely in New York.
How 9/11 changed New York s̓ Muslim community
Shahana Hanif, a Brooklyn resident, and her Muslim peers who came of age after Sept. 11
witnessed the ways their communities were deeply affected by police measures targeting
Muslim residents.
“What we realized and had to grapple with from a very young age was fighting for a more
democratic city, fighting for equity without even knowing these terms,” Ms. Hanif said.
For Ms. Hanif, now 30, the fallout from Sept. 11 became a driving force in her pursuit of
politics. And other Muslims from her generation are entering New York’s electoral ranks, too.
Survivors of 9/11 are still falling ill
By some estimates, more than 400,000 people in Lower Manhattan were exposed to toxic
material from the pulverized towers, leading to health issues — some fatal — that were
diagnosed many years later.

John Mormando, 54, was working as a commodities broker a few blocks from ground zero in
2001. He later underwent a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer, an
ailment suffered by a cluster of men who spent time near the site.
“We were told that the air was fine, and we needed to get back to work,” he said. “There were
buildings still on fire.”

Dear Diary:
I was walking in Morningside Park when I saw a mama duck and her ducklings heading out
of the park. I tried to get her to go back but she wouldn’t.
A woman called out and said the ducks were headed for Central Park.
Really? I asked. How is she going to get there?
We’re going to help, the woman said.
And we did. Seven of us, all strangers, guided the duck and her ducklings through the street,
stopping traffic, picking babies up onto the curb and following closely to make sure they all
got there safely.
When we got to Central Park, all the babies intact, they emerged from the bushes and hopped
in the water. We all cheered. It was so energizing. We parted ways, and I walked home with a
huge smile on my face.
The highlight was a truck driver who cursed at us when we stopped traffic, only to let out a
gasp when he saw the ducks.
“Oh my God,” he yelled. “They’re so cute.”
